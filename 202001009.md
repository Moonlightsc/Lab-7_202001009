Ans:- Equivalence Partitioning:

Invalid input:

day < 1 or day > 31 or month < 1 or month > 12 or year < 1900 or year > 2015:

An error message should be displayed indicating that the input is invalid.

Valid input:

day, month, year are within valid ranges:

If the input date is not the minimum valid date (January 1, 1900), then the function should return the previous date.

If the input date is the minimum valid date, then an error message should be displayed indicating that there is no previous date.

Boundary Value Analysis:

Invalid input:

day = 0, month = 1, year = 1900: An error message should be displayed indicating that the input is invalid.

day = 1, month = 0, year = 1900: An error message should be displayed indicating that the input is invalid.

day = 1, month = 1, year = 1899: An error message should be displayed indicating that the input is invalid.

day = 32, month = 1, year = 1900: An error message should be displayed indicating that the input is invalid.

day = 31, month = 2, year = 1900: An error message should be displayed indicating that the input is invalid.

day = 29, month = 2, year = 1900: An error message should be displayed indicating that the input is invalid.

day = 31, month = 4, year = 1900: An error message should be displayed indicating that the input is invalid.

day = 31, month = 6, year = 1900: An error message should be displayed indicating that the input is invalid.

day = 31, month = 9, year = 1900: An error message should be displayed indicating that the input is invalid.

day = 31, month = 11, year = 1900: An error message should be displayed indicating that the input is invalid.

day = 30, month = 2, year = 1904: An error message should be displayed indicating that the input is invalid.

Valid input:

day = 1, month = 1, year = 1900: An error message should be displayed indicating that there is no previous date.

day = 2, month = 1, year = 1900: The function should return the date (January 1, 1900).

day = 1, month = 2, year = 1900: The function should return the date (January 31, 1899).

day = 1, month = 3, year = 1900: The function should return the date (February 28, 1900).

day = 28, month = 2, year = 1900: The function should return the date (February 27, 1900).

day = 1, month = 4, year = 1900: The function should return the date (March 31, 1900).

day = 1, month = 5, year = 1900: The function should return the date (April 30, 1900).

day = 1, month = 6, year = 1900: The function should return the date (May 31, 1900).

Ans:- Equivalence Partitioning:

Equivalence partitioning is a black-box testing technique that divides the input domain of a program into equivalence classes based on the behavior of the program. The idea is to group inputs that should be processed in the same way by the program.

For the function binarySearch, we can divide the input domain into the following equivalence classes:

v is not present in the array a (result should be -1)

v is present in the array a, and appears only once

v is present in the array a, and appears more than once

v is the first element of the array a

v is the last element of the array a

v is in the middle of the array a

a has only one element, which is v

a is empty

Boundary Value Analysis:

Boundary value analysis is another black-box testing technique that focuses on the edges of the input domain. The idea is to test the program with inputs that are at or near the edges of the input domain, since these inputs are more likely to expose errors in the program.

For the function binarySearch, we can test the following boundary cases:

v is not present in the array a (result should be -1)

v is present in the array a, and appears only once

v is present in the array a, and appears more than once

v is the first element of the array a

v is the last element of the array a

v is in the middle of the array a

v is less than the first element of the array a

v is greater than the last element of the array a

a has only one element, which is v

a is empty

**P4. The following problem has been adapted from The Art of Software Testing, by G. Myers (1979). The** 

**a function triangle takes three integer parameters that are interpreted as the lengths of the sides of a** 

**triangle. It returns whether the triangle is equilateral (three lengths equal), isosceles (two lengths equal),** 

**scalene (no lengths equal), or invalid (impossible lengths).**

**P5. The function prefix (String s1, String s2) returns whether or not the string s1 is a prefix** 

**of string s2 (you may assume that neither s1 nor s2 is null).** 

**public static boolean prefix(String s1, String s2)** 

**{** 

**if (s1.length() > s2.length())** 

**{** 

**return false;** 

**}** 

**for (int i = 0; i < s1.length(); i++)** 

**{** 

**if (s1.charAt(i) != s2.charAt(i))** 

**{** 

**return false;** 

**}** 

**}** 

**return true;** 

**}**

Ans:- Equivalence Partitioning:

Inputs that belong to the same equivalence class should have the same behavior in the program.

There are two possible classes for each input string: prefixes of s2 and non-prefixes of s2.

Test Suite:

Prefix s1 of s2: true

Not prefix of s2: false

Boundary Value Analysis:

We should consider boundary cases like empty strings, s1 equals s2, s1 of length 1, and s2 of length 1.

Test Suite:

s1 and s2 are both empty strings: true

s1 is an empty string and s2 is not: true

s1 and s2 are equal non-empty strings: true

s1 is a prefix of s2: true

s1 is not a prefix of s2 and both are non-empty strings: false

s1 is a single character and s2 has more than one character but does not start with s1: false

s2 is a single character and is not s1: false


**P6. Consider again the triangle classification program (P4) with a slightly different specification: The program** 

**reads floating values from the standard input. The three values A, B, and C are interpreted as** 

**representing the lengths of the sides of a triangle. The program then prints a message to the standard output** 

**that states whether the triangle, if it can be formed, is scalene, isosceles, equilateral, or right angled.** 

**Determine the following for the above program:**

**a) Identify the equivalence classes for the system**

**b) Identify test cases to cover the identified equivalence classes. Also, explicitly mention which test case**

**would cover which equivalence class.**

**(Hint: you must need to be ensure that the identified set of test cases cover all identified equivalence**

**classes)**

**c) For the boundary condition A + B > C case (scalene triangle), identify test cases to verify the**

**boundary.**

**d) For the boundary condition A = C case (isosceles triangle), identify test cases to verify the**

**boundary.**

**e) For the boundary condition A = B = C case (equilateral triangle), identify test cases to verify the**

**boundary.**

**f) For the boundary condition A**

**2 + B2 = C2**

**case (right-angle triangle), identify test cases to verify**

**the boundary.**

**g) For the non-triangle case, identify test cases to explore the boundary.**

**h) For non-positive input, identify test points.**

Ans :-  a) Equivalence classes:

Invalid triangle (sum of two sides is less than or equal to the third side)

Scalene triangle (all sides have different lengths)

Isosceles triangle (two sides have the same length)

Equilateral triangle (all three sides have the same length)

Right-angled triangle (satisfies the Pythagorean theorem)

b) Test cases:

Invalid triangle: {A=1, B=2, C=4}

Scalene triangle: {A=3, B=4, C=5}

Isosceles triangle: {A=4, B=4, C=5}

Equilateral triangle: {A=6, B=6, C=6}

Right-angled triangle: {A=3, B=4, C=5}

c) Boundary test case for A+B=C: {A=1, B=2, C=3}

d) Boundary test case for A=C: {A=3, B=4, C=3}

e) Boundary test case for A=B=C: {A=5, B=5, C=5}

f) Boundary test case for A^2 + B^2 = C^2: {A=3, B=4, C=5}

g) Boundary test case for non-triangle: {A=1, B=2, C=5}

h) Test cases for non-positive input: {A=-1, B=2, C=3}, {A=1, B=-2, C=3}, {A=1, B=2, C=-3}, {A=-1, B=-2, C=-3}

Note: Test case 1 covers equivalence class 1, test case 2 covers equivalence class 2, test case 3 covers equivalence class 3, test case 4 covers equivalence class 4, and test case 5 covers equivalence class 5.
